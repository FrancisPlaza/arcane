# Arcane
Easy to use parameter filter extending [Strong Parameters](https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters).
Arcane provides you with helpers which guide you in leveraging regular Ruby classes and object oriented
design patterns to organise and easily harnass the power of strong parameters in Rails 3 and 4.

Arcane magic is real and reliable, no cheap tricks.
Inspired by [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit)
